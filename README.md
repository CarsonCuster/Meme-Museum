## *Description:*

The Meme Museum is an interactable, multiplayer VR experience that brings players into a virtual museum to reminisce and learn about memes, chosen by developers, with friends. The experience offers descriptions for every meme on display, two interactions for the player that trigger meme videos through the pressing of buttons and a custom meme face that appears on every player's avatar.
